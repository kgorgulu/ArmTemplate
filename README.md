# ArmTemplate
Use Bash/PowerShell to create a resource group. To check your resource group you can go to the Azure portal.
az group create --name MyResourceGroup --location eastus

Create a file named “storage-account-with-arm.json” 
Write your code in the ARM template file to create (i) a storage account in the resource group that you just created. OK (ii) a virtual machine in the resource group that you just created. 
Deploy your ARM template via Azure Portal.
